### Learnings

- Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.
- Issues in code generally come in three forms: `syntax errors` that prevent your program from running, `runtime errors` where your code has unexpected behavior, or `logical errors` where your code doesn't do what you intended.
- In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen.
