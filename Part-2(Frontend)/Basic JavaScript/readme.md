### Learnings

JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.

#### [Comment Your JavaScript Code]()
- There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:
    1. Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment.
    2. You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */.
-  As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.

#### [Declare JavaScript Variables]()
- JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.
- Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.
- In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.
- Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

#### [Storing Values with the Assignment Operator]()
- In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).
- If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

#### [Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another]()
- After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.

#### [Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator]()
- It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

#### [Declare String Variables]()
- "your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

#### [Understanding Uninitialized Variables]()
- When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.
